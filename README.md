## Airplane Delay Classification / Detection
### Project Overview

Flight delays are one of the most common issues faced in the aviation industry, affecting both passengers and airlines financially and operationally. This project focuses on predicting whether a flight will be delayed or on time, using machine learning classification techniques.

The system analyzes historical flight data such as departure time, airline, weather conditions, origin/destination airports, and other relevant features. By building predictive models, the goal is to classify upcoming flights into delay categories and provide insights into the main factors contributing to delays.

 ## Objectives

Preprocess and clean flight datasets for accurate analysis.

Explore patterns and correlations between flight delays and different factors (airline, weather, schedule, etc.).

Train and evaluate machine learning models for delay prediction.

Provide a tool that helps airlines and passengers anticipate potential delays.

### Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, etc.

Visualization: Flight delay trends and feature importance

### Dataset

The dataset contains flight information such as:

Airline â€“ Carrier operating the flight

Flight Number â€“ Identifier for the flight

Date/Time â€“ Scheduled departure and arrival times

Origin & Destination Airports â€“ Source and target airport codes

Weather Conditions â€“ (if available)

Delay Status â€“ Target variable (On-Time / Delayed)

### Workflow

Data Preprocessing â€“ Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalization.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Identifying patterns and visualizing flight trends.

Model Training â€“ Applying multiple ML classifiers.

Model Evaluation â€“ Measuring performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Prediction â€“ Classifying whether a flight will be delayed.

### Future Improvements

Integrating real-time weather data for more accurate predictions.

Deploying the model as a web app or API for live usage.

Expanding the model to predict delay duration (regression approach).

ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can assist in predicting flight delays, helping both airlines optimize operations and passengers better plan their travel. By leveraging historical data and predictive analytics, we take a step towards smarter and more efficient air travel.
